A portfolio website is every designerâ€™s dream project, which can sometimes turn into an endless pursuit of perfection. An opportunity to showcase yourself, reveal your talents, woo the crowd. But are you ever satisfied with the end results? With the medium being so fluid, can there ever be a real final product?

I remember what it was like to build my first portfolio website back in 2006. Fullscreen Flash websites were all the rage and I was determined to learn everything I could about it what it would take to build my own. With all the sounds and all the movement I could figure out, I wanted to show any user that came across the website that I was cool.

I loved building that Flash website. It brought great attention to my skills in Flash, but maintaining it was atrocious. As my portfolio grew, I dreaded going in to update it, so when I was living in Santa Rosa I decided it was time for a new update. This time I wanted to play on words with my last name, leading me to knottyouraveragedesigner.com. Whew, what a tongue twister!  Yet I loved it and felt that it worked with my personality as a designer. Confident, clever, with a wink and a nod to my goofy side. My theme was tying ideas together using rope knots to bring each panel together. With the creative side decided, I knew the problem I really wanted to tackle: how was I going to maintain it in the future? Turns out the answer was HTML, CSS, and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).

Since then, I have been able to shrink my domain down to knottaverage.com. The name still shows a proud designer yet a little wiser with age, using new technologies in a more responsible fashion but still chasing the carrot in an endless pursuit to create perfection.
