  <h2>My Role</h2>
  <p>I was lead UX designer and UI developer from 2008 through 2012, at which
    point I chose to move to a freelance position and have maintained a working
    relationship to this day. FireStorm Graphix (FSG) specializes in providing
    a unique customer experience for race car drivers and my role has been to
    design and optimize the user experience for the e-commerce platform.</p>
  <p>Once the 2014 redesign was launched, organic traffic increased by 49%.</p>

  <h2>2011 Redesign</h2>
  <p>FSG was originally written on the OSCommerce platform, with hidden secrets
    lurking around every file directory. With a heavily customized codebase,
    FireStorm needed a redesign using the hip design trends of 2011. I worked
    with a 1280-pixel design grid and began the process of migrating the HTML
    architecture from a table layout to a CSS and DIV-based layout.</p>

  <h2>2014 Redesign</h2>
  <p>2012-2014 was a great time for race car decals; visitors turning into
    customers was rising and with FSG being featured in Circle Track magazine,
    we were able to establish ourselves as the leader in high-quality race car
    decals.</p>
  <p>During 2014, FSG made the choice to move away from the OSCommerce to the
    Magento platform. Looking to streamline user flows and increase conversion
    goals, FSG wanted to put emphasis on building a framework that was heavily
    influenced by SEO standards.</p>
  <p>At the time Amazon still had a left-side navigation; for design inspiration
    and considering our large selection of race car decals to reduce cognitive
    friction, we followed this design pattern, laying out the full details of
    our inventory.</p>

  <h2>Most Memorable Challenge?</h2>
  <p>Working with the heavily customized OSCommerce platform was extremely difficult.
    The file structure was massive and at times updating files could make or break
    other pages. The 2011 redesign was not easy, needing multiple template files
    updated just to get the right look and feel on customized single product pages.</p>
