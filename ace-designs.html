  <h2>My Role</h2>
  <p>I worked with executive management at Ace Ticket and was responsible for
    designing the user experience as well as building the front-end architecture
    for the e-commerce platform. My involvement with Ace Ticket's e-commerce team
    garnered positive reviews by users on TrustPilot.com and increased conversion
    goals by 3% from 2012-2014.</p>
  <p>I also planned, collaborated, and designed multiple Ace Ticket high-value
    web properties including Boston.comâ€™s 2014 ticket portal, Tickets for Charity,
    Ace Embrace, and Ace Ticket Concierge. On top of that, I was also responsible
    for creating and managing cohesive marketing campaigns including all digital
    marketing, mass marketing mediums, print, and billboard advertising to enhance
    the customer experience.</p>

  <h2>2015 Redesign Goal</h2>
  <p>During my time at Ace Ticket, I witnessed shifts in the ticket broker industry.
    Electronic tickets started to become not only accepted but encouraged at venues.
    This change in the industry required Ace to have a mobile-friendly website,
    something easier to maintain and easy to view when out and about.</p>
  <p>In 2015, technology for stadium maps evolved to incorporate touch technologies
    and recognize responsive design trends. The responsive redesign for Ace
    Ticket's e-commerce platform utilized these newer technologies, allowing
    Ace the chance build a seamless experience across various devices.</p>

  <h2>Web Properties</h2>
  <p>From 2012 to 2014, I was lead UX designer and played a large role in

    Mobile platforms, Ace Embrace, and Boston.com's ticket portal as well as
    managing Email and Banner Ad Campaigns.</p>

  <h2>Marketing Campaigns</h2>
  <p>Other responsibilities I had at Ace Ticket were to manage and create all
    branding and mass-marketing art direction that can be found in a variety
    of Greater Boston area publications, such as the Boston Globe, Clear
    Channel Outdoor, and Red Sox Magazine.</p>

  <h2>Most Memorable Challenge</h2>
  <p>The hardest challenge I faced was designing and developing the responsive
    architecture for Ace Ticket's Email template. This was at a time when hardly
    anyone was doing it yet, and mobile email clients were still not ready for
    responsive emails. Even when I finally came across a boilerplate (created by Email on Acid)
    that I could work with, the amount of blood, sweat, tears, and development hours it took
    to build and test remains a vivid memory.</p>
