  <h2>My Role</h2>
  <p>I worked with executive management at Quanta Imaging and was responsible
    for art direction of the marketing website and creating a client portal
    concept for the non-clinical imaging&nbsp;startup.

  <h2>The Marketing Website</h2>
  <p>In the clinical imaging sector, a company's brand identity can be very
    'clinical'. Quanta's competitors were using dry design concepts for
    their marketing websites containing massive amounts of text with little
    to no art direction to make it readable.</p>
  <p>After discussing this design issue with the executive stakeholders
    of Quanta Imaging, they felt that the marketing website should reflect
    some character but keep a sense of professionalism. After a few design
    iterations, we were able to find Quanta Imaging's voice by blending custom
    scientific iconography with beautiful bold photography to offset the clinical
    imagery.</p>

  <h2>Client Portal:<br>Sign In and Dashbaord</h2>
  <p>Quanta Imaging wanted to offer a quality service for their clients,
    and we achieved this by building a client portal allowing Quanta to
    streamline the process for clients to order clinical results.</p>

  <h2>Prototyping with XD</h2>
  <p>Once I began the design process, I felt it was a great opportunity to
    try my luck with Adobe XD. The new prototyping tool helped validate design
    decisions as well as make sure that the marketing website met the business
    goals of the executive stakeholders.</p>

  <h2>Most Memorable Challenge</h2>
  <p>Wrapping my head around the vernacular of non-clinical imaging was very
    intimidating. Once I finally understood what I was trying to build, the
    next challenge was to figure out a way to take the visuals of X-rays of
    lab rats and make them look pretty.</p>
