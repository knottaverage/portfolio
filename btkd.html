  <h2>The Marketing Website</h2>
  <p>Boston TKD was looking to revamp their online marketing presence. Since
    management was already familiar with Wordpress as their CMS, I went on to
    write a new template from scratch.</p>
  <p>Working with a blank HTML5 template, I began building a theme that
    would easily match their new design.</p>

  <h2>The Schedule</h2>
  <p>When I take on a new marketing project, one of my first requests is to view
    the analytics. I love numbers, especially these numbers; they always give me
    a clear insight into my first burning question, "What is the highest viewed
    page?" When I don't have much data to start designing with, I can at least
    feel comfortable knowing that I have pages that need special attention.</p>
  <p>The schedule page for any fitness facility is always the highest viewed
    page, so making sure users of the Boston TKD could easily view their
    schedule on desktop and mobile space was crucial.</p>
