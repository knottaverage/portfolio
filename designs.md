      <p>During my time at Ace Ticket, I got to see a lot of change happen in the ticket broker industry. Electronic tickets started to become more widely accepted and encouraged at venues. This change in the industry required a more mobile friendly website, something easier to maintain while easy to view while out on the town.</p>
      <p>The following demo is a spike on a responsive redesign for the website to bring Ace Ticket up to date on new web technologies and practices. Links on the demo are limited to the event page.</p>

      <p>Ace has something special about them compared to other ticket brokers not just in the Greater Boston area, but in the industry as a whole. They know Boston based events better than anyone and offer a customer service  have yet to seen be rivaled by any company with an e-commerce experience.</p>
      <p>Watching Sales and Operations teams share their knowledge and interact with customers, I felt the site had a standard to live up to. To be an extension for the teams and make the user feel as if they got a box office treatment in the comfort of their homes.</p>

      <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced during my time at Ace was building a responsive email template at a time in 2012 when not many companies were, especially the competition . So many email clients to target, so many options for failure. Testing was a nightmare, but I felt like the underdog rising to the challenge every time I made a fix for Outlook just to break Gmail.</p>
      <p>A year later of iterations, extensive research with a dash of Email on Acid’s testing software, I was finally able to put together an elegant responsive email template that felt natural on all devices.</p>

      <p>We build blogs for content, to help consume knowledge or to listen and help build opinions. Ace Ticket’s blog design was centered around two key factors. The first being on target with Ace’s online branding, the second was for the mass amount of traffic trying to learn more about Fenway park.</p>
      <p>Ace’s venue knowledge is extensive. But it is staggering to to see the amount of unique visitors searching for key terms like “Fenway seating” or “obstructed views”. Ace’s blog was another research tool used by dedicated fans looking for the best deal on a pair of Field Box seats near the Green Monster.</p>

      <p>Ace Embrace’s logo is probably one of my favorite designs to date. So when it came time to create the charity's web presence I wanted a different type of feeling compared to Ace’s usual design treatment of sporty and fast.</p>
      <p>I wanted Ace Embrace to slow down, create a warmer environment, evoking the feeling of your first game as a child, the thrill of seeing the players in action for that first time. Still while using brand colors of course. It was important to represent the many children’s charities Ace donated to so, Ace understands that feeling, they understand how going to an event can help guide the path our future generation.</p>

      <p>Fast, energetic, these qualities are sought out when racers look for their decals. Firestorm Graphix wanted that speedy look,  and with a vast catalog of products, keeping the navigation clear was very important during the design process.</p>
      <p>With so many products being offered Firestorm didn’t want to hide their navigation in a dropdown menu. Customers would come to the ecommerce site with an agenda, rarely ever browsing. So keeping the full navigation open and persistent from page to page became a design choice later down the road.</p>

          <p class="process--heading">Ace Ticket drawings and illustrations</p>
          <p>Often designs in the ticket broker industry are pretty cut and dry: insert a sports or event image, copy about being a fan or part of the crowd, name of the broker, and, if you're lucky to use it, the logo of a popular Boston sports team to bring it all home.</p>
          <p>It makes sense, but when everyone else is doing it, the only thing really setting these brokers apart is the cost of the seat they are trying to sell.</p>
          <p>So when the holidays came rolling around, I felt it was time to try something different, something more light and fun and with touch of familiarity, which gave me the idea to create "Jimmy the Snowfan", "New Year’s Jimmy", "Lovebirds", along with many others ideas.</p>
